# Synth

My sound synthesis and DSP playground.

The [initial commit](https://github.com/liquidev/synth/tree/22d3f03d32bc4a9b7f466e8aa0e34a141556dcf5)
can be used as a starting point for your own experimentation with sound, especially oscillators.

## Building

```sh
$ meson setup build
$ ninja -C build
```

To run:

```sh
$ ./build/src/synth
```
